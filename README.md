==========

The purpose of the AR Project is to recreate 3D objects based on original 2D images.

Current Version
---------------

The current version implements OpenCV and PyOpenGL and is written for Python3.

Latest supported OpenCV version is 3.4.2.17 due to patented SIFT on newer versions.

OpenCV 3.4.2.17 can be installed using pip:

    pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.17

PyOpenGL can be obtained from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ as the default package installed using pip may raise some errors.

Additional required packages include numpy, pygame and Pillow which can also be installed using pip:
